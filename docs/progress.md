# SDTV Platform Progress

## Current status

- Active branch: `feature/publishing-platform-v2`
- Publishing Platform Sprints 1–4: complete
- Publishing Platform Sprint 5A: complete
- Publishing Platform Sprint 5B: code complete; migration and provider key required for live use
- Publishing Platform Sprint 6: complete
- Publishing Platform Sprint 7 internal pipeline: complete
- External automatic channel adapters: intentionally pending credentials and provider-specific implementation
- Deployment and merge status: not performed by the Sprint 4 development work

## Completed publishing foundation

Sprints 1–3 established:

- Publication database schema
- Publication repositories and services
- Section registry and section engine
- Content discovery and publication snapshots
- Publication-item repository and service

## Sprint 4 — Editorial Workspace

Completed functionality:

- Publication-item state hook
- Loading, refresh, errors, optimistic mutations, and rollback
- Two-second debounced autosave with saved/saving/error indicators
- Automatic and manual retry
- Stale-request protection for concurrent edits
- Include/exclude and feature/unfeature
- Title, description, image URL, and destination URL editing
- Item deletion
- Drag-and-drop and move-button ordering
- Responsive section selector, item list, editor, toolbar, and live preview
- Status badges for Included, Excluded, Featured, and Edited
- Studio navigation to the item workspace
- Service-boundary authorization for the editorial page

## Build readiness completed

- Replaced obsolete Next.js lint command with ESLint 9 flat configuration.
- Added a dependency lockfile.
- Updated the TypeScript target from ES5 to ES2017.
- Recorded Next.js-required TypeScript settings.
- Normalized browser Supabase clients to the shared prerender-safe helper.
- Verified the production build through compilation, TypeScript, page-data collection, and generation of all 155 static pages.
- Verified targeted Sprint 4 lint with zero errors.

## Database changes in Sprint 4

No new Sprint 4 migration was required. The editorial workspace uses the existing publication-item schema and service layer.

## Sprint 5A — Unified Publication Editor

Completed functionality:

- One `Open Editor` action from each publication card
- Single editor URL for sections, items, discovery, and preview
- Responsive section rail with selection, drag-and-drop, and move controls
- Add and delete custom text sections
- Preserve built-in sections by using inclusion/exclusion instead of deletion
- Embedded approved-content discovery, filtering, selection, and snapshot import
- Existing item workspace and autosave reused without duplication
- Existing section editor and preview reused without duplication
- Repository, service, hook, and component boundaries maintained

No migration was required. Custom text sections use the existing publication-section schema and RLS policies.

## Known issues

- Repository-wide lint reports legacy findings outside Sprint 4, primarily explicit `any` usage and newer React lint rules in existing modules. These should be handled as scoped maintenance rather than mixed into publishing sprints.
- A Vercel preview should be verified from the current feature-branch head before any merge.
- Production environment variables remain required for live Supabase operations even though prerender uses a safe placeholder client.

## Sprint 5B recommendation

Completed functionality:

- Secure admin-only AI generation API
- Existing Gemini-first/OpenAI-fallback provider convention
- Item, section, and publication regeneration controls
- Review-before-apply workflow that protects manual edits
- Source attribution captured with item generation
- Versioned administrator prompt management
- Auditable generation success and failure history
- No additional npm dependency

Operational requirements:

- Apply `20260729170000_add_publication_ai_content_engine.sql` to Supabase.
- Configure `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` for live generation.

## Sprint 6 recommendation

Completed functionality:

- Canonical complete-publication preview model
- Website preview
- Newsletter preview
- Instagram preview
- Facebook preview
- LinkedIn preview
- Mobile preview
- Print/PDF preview
- Native Print / Save PDF workflow
- Standalone HTML export
- Structured JSON export
- Included-section and included-item filtering
- Responsive preview controls within the unified editor

No database migration or npm dependency was required for Sprint 6.

## Sprint 7 recommendation

Completed functionality:

- Website, newsletter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, PDF, and email channel selection
- Canonical output snapshot generation
- Immediate and scheduled output preparation
- Per-channel output status
- Explicit confirmation before publishing handoff
- Retry pathway for failed outputs
- Scheduled-output cancellation
- Publishing history and immutable attempt audit records
- Attempt count, last error, and last-attempt tracking
- Isolated channel adapter registry
- Safe manual-handoff default for every external channel

Operational requirements:

- Apply `20260730100000_add_publication_pipeline_history.sql` to Supabase.
- Apply the earlier Sprint 5 AI migration if it is not already installed.
- Implement and test provider-specific automatic adapters only after credentials and publishing-account requirements are confirmed.
